## [Psalm 1](https://www.bible.com/bible/111/PSA.1.niv)

I love this Psalm as it reminds me about delight. I love to practice being delighted. Improving or changing something in your life takes discipline, devotions and a never give up attitude. 

I find though if I focus on the discipline of the things I need to do to get to where I want to be then I can get discouraged, dismayed and just want to quit.

When I practise being delighted in the person I am becoming and celebrating little wins I find that the discipline comes so much easier.

What are you delighted about today?
