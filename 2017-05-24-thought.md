## [James 1:4](https://www.bible.com/bible/111/JAM.1.4.niv)

What would it be like to 'lack nothing'?

Personally I think it would be pretty awesome. What I love about this verse is that it shows us the way to be lacking in nothing. The tip is to let perseverance finish its work. Other versions use patience. Either way sometimes we have to wait for things. Not only that if we look a few verses earlier it says that trails are to be approached with joy and rejoycing. 

No one enjoys trials. If they are the way to produce endurance that makes them a good thing and the pressure of a trial produces your best work.

Approach your trails with joy.
