## [Psalm 63](https://www.bible.com/bible/111/PSA.63.niv)

The thirst described in the first verse of this Psalm has always struck me. 

When your mouth is dry the only thing that can slake that thirst is a long, cold drink of water.

Sometimes we try to slake our thirst with other things that don't solve the thirst. Literally that could be a 'soft' drink or a soda. Metaphorically that could be sport or music or a hobby we are passionate about. These things won't fill the hole in our life like passion for God can. Jesus describes himself as living water and whomever drinks that water will then never thirst. [John 4](https://www.bible.com/en-GB/bible/111/JHN.4.1-26.NIV)

Are you thirsty and what are you drinking to fill that thirst?
